                    <p><strong>Angry Penne </strong>is a restaurant specializing in italian cuisine. Many would name it
                        their favorite restaurant in the island for many reasons. One of them being that their pasta is
                        freshly made everyday
                        and their pizzas are to die for. There is really no other restaurant that can compare to the
                        simple yet delicious flavors they present. Not to mention their awesome customer service!</p>

                    <p>Amongst the numerous Thai restaurants on the island, <strong>Wild Bills</strong> wins the best in
                        our
                        book. Wild Bills never falls off its throne. While many restaurants on island continue to update
                        their menus and taste in their dishes, the rich flavors of the
                        traditional Thai food in Wild Bills is consistent. Out of all the Thai restaurants, Wild Bills
                        is the most flavorful.</p>

                        Saipan is one of Korea's favorite summer destinations. With that,
                        there are many restaraunts that offer comfort Korean food available on-island. My favorite of
                        all of them is <strong>Nam Dae Mun</strong>. With prices hard to beat and flavors hard to find in other
                        K-restaurants, Nam Dae Mun makes it to the top 3.

                        How can you say 'No' to sushi? There is no doubt as to why The Sushi Spot wins 1st place for
                        Best Sushi under the Best of the Marianas. <strong>The Sushi Spot</strong> offers the best variation of
                        sushi on-island as well as the most flavorful. I mean look at those plates! When visiting or living Saipan, do not overlook it for its small
                        space.You will be amazed.
